### What is this Game about?
SisijaFight is a little bit different from other shooters:
#### There are different gamemodes:
* Classic Fight: A typical deathmatch all-against-each-other (AAEO)
* Tactic Fight: There are different teams and each Player has its own role (e.g. healer, solidier, leader...)
* Story mode: play in different worlds and universes to free characters, wich will appear in the lobby to use!
 * so that's the way to get new players
